# TITLE
FinTech Domain: Capital Investment & Management
## Overview and Origin

* Smartlands Platform Ltd.

* When was the company incorporated?

The company was founded in 2015 and incorporated in 2017

* Who are the founders of the company?

CEO: Ilia Obrazctov
CMO: Iaroslava Tkalich
CPO: Viktor Krekotin

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

Originally based in London, the founders of the company sought to address areas in the investment banking field that were obsolete or simply ineffective. 
Being early adopters of blockchain technology, this company plans to revolutionize capital investment. Specifically, in areas such 
as raising capital for startups and tokenizing assets and securities in fields like real estate, agriculture, and private equity. 

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

Smartlands has received $19M to-date in seed funding. 

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Smartlands highlights many problems and areas that are outdated with the current financial business models in capital investment. Three main areas that are highlighted are:
Bank deposits, Real Estate, and the stock market. Smartlands mentions that bank deposits are currently sitting in bank accounts with no growth opportunity unless invested
in a security and if it does it sits in an interest-bearing account only a bit over zero percent APR. The real estate industry allows investors to invest in REITs and MBS/CDS
but it does not allow much convenience for the investor as one would need to seek lots of information before investing in one of these. Lastly, the company boldly points out
the inflated value of the stock market and even goes as far to call it a legalized pyramid scheme. When one purchases a stock in a company, they do not actually own that 
value of the company. 


* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

This company seeks to target start-ups as their main selling point is to help companies raise capital by using the blockchain to issue security tokens. I was not able to 
find information or data explaining their market size but the company has made clear their target markets are the UK and moving towards the US which are two very dense 
markets. Their competitive advantage is that 1. they are one of the first companies to be successful in experimenting and implementing the tokenization of real estate and securities. 
2. Have partnered with big names in the space such as Sotheby's and are recognized by well-known financial media & news platforms. 3. They offer a convenient and easy-to-use platform 
for crowdfunding not only start-ups but real estate projects as well. Their goal is to provide a whole new array of investment opportunities other than what are available today
and make it convenient as well. The company will allow investors who purchase tokens(stocks) to physically own a stake in the company their investing in.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

Clearly the company is utilizing the blockchain to accomplish their mission. To be specific they are using the Stellar network to enable fast and cheap transaction 
speeds. They are using an app as a platform to make it convenient for their customers to conduct business.

Capital Investment

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

In Q1 of 2018 the company was able to focus on widening their business model to cover all real assets. The emergence of this company and other companies in a similar scope
have introduced a new method of crowdfunding and fundraising. The utilization of distributed ledger technology allows for trust to be enforced in this domain. The company calls out
the current stock market to be a giant Ponzi scheme. The company is making it a personal mission for trust to be a main factor in the industry. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

Smartlands has tracked their progress as a company by providing a timeline of their main achievements. The company has also displayed the several financial media platforms
they have been featured in. The company has made an influence in the UK and, according to an article on crowdfundinsider.com, is currently working on making its service
available to the United States. Since their launch in 2017 the company has made progress towards widespread adoption in both UK and US markets. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

This company in terms of revenue has maintained an average revenue of 16M each quarter according to zoominfo.com and currently has 83 employees. Although the company is still in 
its start-up phase, it is performing pretty well compared to other startups in the same domain who are still in their developmental phases. 
Although it still has a while to go to compete with already established VC firms like Benchmark and Y Combinator. These companies have yet to transfer to the growing demand
for more distributed & trust business models. 


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers or use your imagination!)

I would suggest they offer a guide or coaching service similar to the way Y Combinator offers investment resources and mentoring services. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

It would give them more of a competitive advantage than they already have. It will also help people unfamiliar with this new crowdfunding method transition to this new way 
of funding startups and real estate.  

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

With the COVID rules and stipulations I would suggest using a virtual platform to communicate with customers such as Zoom. Their platform could also provide their own form of 
virtual communication. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

It would give the customer more freedom and independence to have control over crowdfunding their own start-ups or projects without feeling micromanaged by the firm. 
Many start-ups experience this micromanagement as Venture Capital seeks to gain a return on their investment.
